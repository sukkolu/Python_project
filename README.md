In this project, we focused on enhancing customer experience and boosting sales through data analysis. Firstly, we conducted data cleaning and manipulation to ensure the quality and integrity of the dataset. Using popular libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, we performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain valuable insights.

By leveraging the power of data, we identified potential customers across various states, occupations, genders, and age groups. This knowledge allowed us to target specific customer segments and tailor our marketing strategies accordingly, ultimately enhancing the overall customer experience.

Additionally, we delved into sales data to identify the most successful product categories and individual products. By understanding which items were in high demand, we could optimize inventory planning and ensure a timely supply to meet customer demands, resulting in improved sales performance.

Overall, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of data-driven decision-making in improving customer satisfaction and driving sales growth.
